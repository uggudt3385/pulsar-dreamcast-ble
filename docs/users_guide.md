# Dreamcast Wireless Controller Adapter - User Guide

## What You Need

- A standard Dreamcast controller (with cable)
- The wireless adapter board (connected to the controller's cable)
- A Bluetooth Low Energy capable device (phone, tablet, PC, or Dreamcast with BLE receiver like iBlueControlMod)

## First-Time Pairing

1. **Power on** the adapter. The LED will blink green briefly, then turn red while it searches for the controller.
2. Once the controller is detected, the LED turns green.
3. The adapter automatically enters **pairing mode** on first boot (since no device is bonded yet). It will be discoverable for 60 seconds.
4. On your host device, open Bluetooth settings and look for **"Xbox Wireless Controller"**.
5. Select it to pair. The LED will turn solid to indicate a connection.

That's it! The adapter remembers your device and will reconnect automatically in the future.

## Reconnecting

After the first pairing, the adapter reconnects automatically:

1. Power on the adapter.
2. Turn on Bluetooth on your host device.
3. The adapter will find and connect to your previously paired device within a few seconds.

No need to re-pair each time.

## Button Mapping

| Dreamcast | Xbox Equivalent |
|-----------|----------------|
| A | A |
| B | B |
| X | X |
| Y | Y |
| Start | Menu |
| D-pad Up | D-pad Up |
| D-pad Down | D-pad Down |
| D-pad Left | D-pad Left |
| D-pad Right | D-pad Right |
| Left Trigger | Left Trigger |
| Right Trigger | Right Trigger |
| Analog Stick | Left Stick |

The Dreamcast controller has one analog stick, which maps to the left stick. The right stick is not available.

## Sync Button

The sync button on the adapter has three functions:

### Pair with a New Device (Hold 3 seconds)
Hold the sync button for 3 seconds. The LED will blink while you hold it. When released, the adapter enters **pairing mode** for 60 seconds. This clears any existing pairing, so you'll need to pair again from your host device.

### Manual Sleep (Hold 10 seconds)
Keep holding past the 3-second sync point. The LED blink rate will double to indicate sleep is approaching. At 10 seconds, the adapter enters deep sleep immediately. This is useful for conserving battery or allowing the battery to charge on USB without the controller drawing power.

### Toggle Device Name (Triple-press)
Press the sync button three times quickly (within 2 seconds). The LED will flash 5 times to confirm. The adapter toggles between two names:

- **Xbox Wireless Controller** (default) -- compatible with iBlueControlMod and most BLE gamepad receivers
- **Dreamcast Wireless Controller** -- for hosts that don't require the Xbox name

The name preference is saved and persists across power cycles. The adapter resets automatically to apply the new name.

## Battery & Charging

The adapter monitors the LiPo battery and reports the level over Bluetooth (visible in your host device's Bluetooth settings or supported games).

- **Full charge:** 4.2V
- **Empty:** 3.0V

Charge the battery by connecting USB to the XIAO board. A USB power brick or phone charger is recommended for charging. **Note:** Some laptops (especially MacBooks) have smart USB ports that may reduce or cut power when the adapter is in deep sleep, since the USB peripheral is off and the laptop doesn't detect a device. If you notice the battery not charging from a laptop, either use a standard USB charger or keep the adapter awake while plugged in.

## Sleep & Wake

The adapter enters deep sleep to save battery in these situations:

1. **Manual sleep** -- hold the sync button for 10 seconds.
2. **No Bluetooth connection** for 60 seconds after power-on (advertising timeout).
3. **Controller not found** for 60 seconds after Bluetooth connects (detection timeout).
4. **Controller disconnected** for 60 seconds while BLE is connected (re-detect timeout).
5. **No controller input** for 10 minutes while connected (inactivity timeout).

When asleep, the adapter draws minimal power (~5 microamps). The battery charges normally from USB while asleep.

**To wake up:** Press the sync button. The adapter performs a full restart and will reconnect to your paired device.

## LED Indicators

| LED State | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Green blink (3x) | Starting up |
| Solid red | Searching for controller |
| Solid green | Controller found / connected |
| Fast blink (blue) | Pairing mode active (60s) |
| Blink while holding | Sync button held, pending action |
| Fast blink while holding | Past sync point, approaching sleep |
| 5 quick flashes | Name toggle confirmed |
| Off | Sleeping or idle (no BLE connection) |

## Troubleshooting

**Controller not detected (red LED stays on)**
- Check that the controller cable is securely connected to the adapter.
- Make sure the controller is receiving 5V power.
- Try unplugging and re-plugging the controller.

**Can't find "Xbox Wireless Controller" in Bluetooth**
- The adapter may not be in pairing mode. Hold the sync button for 3 seconds to enter pairing mode.
- Make sure you're within Bluetooth range (about 10 meters / 30 feet).
- On some devices, you may need to "forget" the old pairing first, then hold sync for 3 seconds to re-pair.

**Connected but no input**
- Some hosts need a moment after connecting to discover services. Wait a few seconds after the connection is established.
- Try pressing buttons on the Dreamcast controller to verify it's responding.

**Adapter keeps going to sleep**
- Press the sync button to wake it up.
- The adapter sleeps after 60 seconds without a Bluetooth connection, 60 seconds if Bluetooth connects but no controller is detected, or after 10 minutes of no controller input. Keep interacting with the controller to prevent the inactivity timeout.

**Inputs feel wrong or mapped incorrectly**
- The adapter maps Dreamcast buttons to Xbox equivalents. Some hosts may remap these further. Check your host's controller settings.
- If using iBlueControlMod, make sure the device name is set to "Xbox Wireless Controller" (the default). Triple-press sync to toggle if needed.
