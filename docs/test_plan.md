| **Pass/Fail** | System Off entered between 50-70s after disconnect. Wake via sync button starts fresh boot. |
| **Regression Note** | Previously failed: advertising had no timeout, so `advertise()` blocked indefinitely and the sleep check never ran. Fixed by adding 10s advertising timeout to reconnect modes so the loop iterates and checks elapsed time. |

### Bluetooth Qualification Notes

For a product sold commercially, Bluetooth SIG qualification is required. Key points:
- The nRF52840 SoftDevice S140 is already qualified as a Bluetooth subsystem (QDID from Nordic).
- An end-product listing is still needed, referencing the SoftDevice QDID.
- HOGP (HID over GATT Profile) compliance should be verified against the Bluetooth SIG TCRL.
- Cost for end-product listing is typically low when using a pre-qualified subsystem.

### IEC 62133 / Battery Safety Notes

For a product with an integrated LiPo battery sold commercially:
- IEC 62133-2:2017 covers secondary lithium cells and batteries for portable applications.
- Tests include: external short circuit, thermal abuse, crush, overcharge, forced discharge.
- The BQ25101 charge IC provides charge termination, but the overall product must be assessed.
- For a hobby/prototype, focus on: no exposed battery terminals, charge current within cell rating, low-voltage cutoff implemented (PWR-09).
